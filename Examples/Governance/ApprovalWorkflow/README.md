# Governance ApprovalWorkflow

This example shows the governance approval workflow built on top of `MutationRequest.PendingApproval(...)` and `MutationRequestApprovalWorkflowManager`.

It demonstrates:

- mapping `PolicyRequirement` into request-level approval requirements
- multi-actor approvals in the same step
- ordered approval steps
- transition from `Pending` to `Approved` after the final approval
